## ðŸŽ› Available Commands

| Command  | Description                  | Parameters                          |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

## âœ… Implemented Features

- **Shortage model** includes:
  - `Title`: string
  - `Name`: string (who submitted)
  - `Room`: enum (MeetingRoom, Kitchen, Bathroom)
  - `Category`: enum (Electronics, Food, Other)
  - `Priority`: int (1â€“10)
  - `CreatedOn`: datetime

- **Persistence**:
  - All shortages are stored in a local JSON file.
  - Data is retained between application runs.

- **Smart registration**:
  - If a shortage with the same `Title` and `Room` exists:
    - If new `Priority` > old â†’ it overrides.
    - Otherwise â†’ warning is shown.

- **Deletion**:
  - Only the author or admin can delete a shortage.

- **Filtering**:
  - By partial title match (case-insensitive)
  - By `CreatedOn` date range (e.g., `--from 2025-01-01 --to 2025-01-31`)
  - By `Category`
  - By `Room`

## ðŸ“¦ Shortage Model

| Property   | Type     | Description                        |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| Title      | string   | Name of the shortage               |
| Name       | string   | User who created the shortage      |
| Room       | enum     | MeetingRoom, Kitchen, Bathroom     |
| Category   | enum     | Electronics, Food, Other           |
| Priority   | int      | Range from 1 (low) to 10 (critical)|
| CreatedOn  | DateTime | Timestamp of when shortage was created |

---

## âœ… Rules & Behavior

- **Duplicate prevention**:
  - Same `Title` + `Room` not allowed
  - If new `Priority` > existing â†’ replace it
  - Else â†’ warn user, do not register

- **Deletion**:
  - Only the creator or admin can delete

- **Listing**:
  - Admin sees all shortages
  - Users see only their own
  - Results sorted by priority descending

## ðŸ§ª Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented in a separate repository:[TestVismaTask1]([https://github.com/Enysmen/TestVismaTask1.git]).

## âœ¨ Notes

- UI is intentionally minimalistic (console only).
- Code follows OOP principles and .NET coding conventions.
- No database is used â€” only file-based storage.
- Application designed for internship task completion and demonstration of clean architecture and testability.
